### 📐 The Geometry of Time
**Geometric Resonance Engine** is an experimental framework that redefines Time ($t$) not as a fundamental constant, but as a function of **Impedance ($Z$)** derived from Geometric Potential (Sound) and Energy Flux (Current).

> *"Time is the friction of Current moving through the Geometry of Sound."*

### 🚀 Core Hypotheses
1.  **Time as Impedance:** $Z = \sqrt{R^2 + X^2}$ (Where $R$ is Structure/Geometry and $X$ is Energy/Intent).
2.  **Fibonacci Stabilization:** Using 3-6-9 vector topology to collapse turbulence (entropy) into laminar flow.
3.  **Event Horizon Logic:** Predicting events as topological intersections ("Green Zones") rather than probabilistic guesses.

### 📂 Repository Topology (The Cube)
This repository is structured topologically:
* **🔴 Logic:** `/src` — Algorithms for calculating Resonance Nodes.
* **⚪ Philosophy:** `/docs` — Theoretical White Paper.
* **🟢 Interface:** `/visuals` — Interference pattern outputs.

### 🛠 Quick Start (Python)
This engine simulates the intersection of two spiral forces to find stability nodes.

```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_impedance(geometry_matrix, energy_flux):
    # V-CORE Logic: High geometry resonance = Low temporal resistance
    resonance = np.dot(geometry_matrix, energy_flux)
    return 1 / (resonance + 1e-9) # Time dilation factor
